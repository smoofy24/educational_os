# Vilik OS

A custom operating system for ARM architecture.

## About

This project is a personal educational initiative focused on developing an operating system from scratch for ARM architecture. The development is done with mentorship support from AI assistants (Claude, GPT), where the author writes the code themselves and AI serves as a mentor and advisor.

## Project Goals

- Understanding fundamental principles of operating system design
- Working with ARM architecture at a low level
- Implementing core OS functions (boot, memory management, scheduling, etc.)
- Gaining practical experience in systems programming

```

## Requirements

- ARM toolchain (arm-none-eabi-gcc)
- QEMU for ARM emulation (qemu-system-arm)
- Make or CMake for build system

## Build

_(To be added as the project develops)_

## Development

The project is developed incrementally with emphasis on understanding each component. Every significant change is documented and explained.

## License

_(To be determined)_

## Notes

This project serves primarily educational purposes. The code may contain experimental solutions and is not intended for production use.
